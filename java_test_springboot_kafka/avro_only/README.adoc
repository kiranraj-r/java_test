== Apache Avro ==

This module contains a simple demo for Apache Avro as serialization library.
There is no Kafka involved here.

We use the `org.apache.avro:avro` library and the `com.commercehub.gradle.plugin.avro`
Gradle plugin to create Java files from the `src/main/avro/*.avsc` files during the
`generateAvroJava` task.

== Caveats ==

The "logical types" from https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.0/spec.html#Logical+Types are only
hints on files with standard types like "int" or "string".
As of 1.9.2 the Avro library does not generate Java code with actual UUID, LocalDate or BigDecimal
types although a feature request suggested that this feature might come with version 1.10.
